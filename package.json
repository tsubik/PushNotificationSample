Once the device registration token is received, it is sent to a locally running node service where it will be stored for  later use when a push notification needs to be broadcast to all subscribed devices using [node-pushserver](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-pushserver).  The setup to use node-pushserver is discussed more below but see the npm site for specific setup details.",
